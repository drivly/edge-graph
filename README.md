# Edge Graph
Edge-native strongly-consistent globally-distributed graph database built on Cloudflare Worker Durable Objects

It is based on [GraphDL](https://github.com/graphdl/graphdl).  Each database instance generates hypermedia-driven REST APIs, a Javascript SDK with strongly-typed TypeScript interfaces, and a GraphQL API.
