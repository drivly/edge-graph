# Edge Graph
Edge-native strongly-consistent globally-distributed graph database built on Cloudflare Worker Durable Objects

It is based on [GraphDL](https://github.com/graphdl/graphdl).  Each database instance generates hypermedia-driven REST APIs, a Javascript SDK with strongly-typed TypeScript interfaces, and a GraphQL API.

## Background
This was built to manage the [Driv.ly](https://driv.ly) Graph Database API which gets millions of calls per day.

## [ðŸš€ We're hiring!](https://careers.do/apply)
[Driv.ly](https://driv.ly) is simple APIs to buy & sell cars online, funded by some of the [biggest names](https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak) in [automotive](https://fontinalis.com/team/#bill-ford) and [finance & insurance](https://www.detroit.vc)

We're building our entire infrastructure on Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, KV, R2, and PubSub.  If you're as passionate about these transformational technologies as we are, we'd love for you to join our rapidly-growing team.
